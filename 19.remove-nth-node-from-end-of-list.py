#
# Given the head of a linked list, remove the n^th node from the end of the
# list and return its head.
# 
# Follow up:Â Could you do this in one pass?
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
# Output: [1,2,3,5]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1], n = 1
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is sz.
# 1 <= sz <= 30
# 0 <= Node.val <= 100
# 1 <= n <= sz
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while n > 0:
            fast = fast.next
            n -= 1
        if fast is None:
            return head.next
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next

        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return head
