#
# Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and
# return its modified list.
# 
# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked
# list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in
# the end, should remain as it is.
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# 
# Could you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?
# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be
# changed.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
# Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
# Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
# Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the listÂ is in the range sz.
# 1 <= sz <= 5000
# 0 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 1 <= k <= sz
