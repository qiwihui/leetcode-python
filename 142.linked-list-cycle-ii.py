# Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no
# cycle, return null.
# 
# There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
# be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos
# is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected
# to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
# 
# Notice that you should not modify the linked list.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: tail connects to node index 1
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
# second node.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: tail connects to node index 0
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
# first node.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: no cycle
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4].
# -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
# pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        slow = fast = head
        while fast is not None and fast.next is not None:

            if slow == fast:
                break
        if fast is None or fast.next is None:
            return None
        slow = head
